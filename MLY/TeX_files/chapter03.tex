If you have taken a machine learning course such as my machine learning MOOC on
Coursera, or if you have experience applying supervised learning, you will be able to
understand this text.
I assume you are familiar with supervised learning: Learning a function that maps from x
to y, using labeled training examples (x,y). Supervised learning algorithms include linear
regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. There are many forms of machine
learning, but the majority of machine learning’s practical value today is from supervised
learning.
I will frequently refer to neural networks (also known as “deep learning”). You’ll need only a
basic understanding of what they are to follow this text.
If you are not familiar with the concepts mentioned here, watch the first three weeks of
videos in the Machine Learning course on Coursera at http://ml-class.org

如果你之前上过机器学习的课程，比如我在Mooc上的机器学习课程，
或者你对监督学习有应用经验，
那么你会很容易理解这章。

我假设你对\textbf{监督学习}已经很熟悉了：
使用成对的已标记过的训练样本(x,y)
学习一个从x到y的映射（函数）。
常用的监督学习算法包括线性回归，逻辑回归，神经网络等等。
有很多形式的机器学习，但监督学习仍是现在的主流。

我会经常提及到神经网络，也就是深度学习，你只需要对这些后文提到的概念有个基本的了解。

如果你不熟悉以上这些概念，
可以去看我在Courusera上的课程的前三周
